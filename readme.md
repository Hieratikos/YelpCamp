A fully functional full stack application that accepts new users, 
comments and photos. This app is the final project for Colt Steele's 
outstanding [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview) course on Udemy.

I have a working version hosted [here](https://polar-inlet-34353.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku.

I plan on making it more fun in the future ;-)
